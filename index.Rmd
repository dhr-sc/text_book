# Preface{-}  
These exercises are materials for the NOAA Satellite Training Course offered each year by regional nodes of NOAA's CoastWatch program. They demonstrate techniques to extract data from the ERDDAP data servers using the rxtracto library written in R. 


## NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch Program{-}  

NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch provides easy access for everyone to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate.
