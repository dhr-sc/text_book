## CoastWatch Satellite Course
These exercises are materials for the NOAA Satellite Training Course offered each year by regional nodes of NOAA's CoastWatch program. They demonstrate techniques to extract data from the ERDDAP data servers using the rxtracto library written in R. 

## Exercise book contents

This document describes R scripts used for demostrations in the NOAA Satellite Course. The scripts highlight the uses for rerddapXtracto, a R package with functions that allow easy extraction of satellite data from ERDDAP servers.
